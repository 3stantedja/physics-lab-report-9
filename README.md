# AUPHY 120 --- Experiment 9
Lab report for Experiment 9 --- Experiment Name Here.
A LaTeX installation is needed to compile this.

## Packages
The following packages are in use:
- `graphicx`
- `wrapfig`
- `microtype`
- `lm` (as `lmodern`)
- `mathtools`
- `amssymb` (part of `amsmath`)
- `textcomp` (not sure where I used it but just in case)
- `siunitx`
- `parskip`
- `array`

## Compiling
``` bash
$ pdflatex report9.tex
```
Run twice so the references show up --- otherwise it'll just show as (??).

## To-do
[ ] make LaTeX document
[ ] finish the report
[ ] diagram and plots
[ ] adding Mathematica notebook content in the report.
